# Hex
Hex (board game)
This is a project I built using Curses and Python to simulate the board game Hex

To Play, download this code, and run GameCore.py with one of a few arguments:
to play a local game, use "python3 GameCore.py local"
to play a game against a computer, either use "python3 GameCore.py hscore"(so far the best ai) or "python3 GameCore.py dprop"

If you are getting a weird error message and your console is getting messed up, try making your command line window larger!!

There's a lot of work yet to go into this at the moment, namely improving the "getChains" function and "lightDistance" function to prevent "cheaping out" the AI
